# OpenJK + MakerMod
MakerMod recreated as faithfully as possible in the OpenJK rewrite of the Jedi Academy engine. By Awec.

# MakerMod
Makermod is a Star Wars Jedi Knight : Jedi Academy modification that allows players to place model and effect assets from the game in the world, as well as some modifications to the saber system.

Makermod was created by Toast, and the code was later passed on to me (Scooper). Where I continued with bugfixes and development of new features. Having makermod as a project to work on, and being a part of a great coding community in Jedi Academy, has had a huge impact on my life. I got interested in game programming, and started working in the game industry because of how much fun I had had with developing makermod and working with other jacoders.

But it's time to release the code as-is. Since over the last few years it's become very clear that I will not be working any further on it. I never got around to doing my long-planned "proper" release of the source code, where I would do some cleanup and make it more presentable for public eyes. Neither Toast or me show any good programming style in this project. In my own case I blame how inexperienced I was. So be warned, the code is a mess.

# Disclaimer
The code is released as-is, I made sure it compiles on windows and functions, but that's about it. 

# License
The Makermod specific code is released under the MIT license.

# OpenJK

OpenJK is an effort by the JACoders group to maintain and improve the game engines on which the Jedi Academy (JA) and Jedi Outcast (JO) games run on, while maintaining *full backwards compatibility* with the existing games. *This project does not attempt to rebalance or otherwise modify core gameplay*.

Our aims are to:
* Improve the stability of the engine by fixing bugs and improving performance.
* Provide a clean base from which new JO and JA code modifications can be made.
* Make available this engine to more operating systems. To date, we have ports on Linux and macOS.

Currently, the most stable portion of this project is the Jedi Academy multiplayer code, with the single player code in a reasonable state.
